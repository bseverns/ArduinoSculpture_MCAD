# Unit 1 – Blink Like You Mean It

Welcome to the rabbit hole. This unit teaches you:
- How to wire an LED with a resistor so it doesn't die screaming.
- Reading analog values from sensors and mapping them to light.
- Structuring code with classes (yeah, on Arduino) in `1_Blink_OOP.ino`.

Firmware vibes:
- `pinMode`, `digitalWrite`, `analogRead`, `delay`, and a taste of C++ classes.

Electrical lowdown:
- Ohm's law, current limiting, why 5V through an LED without resistance is a bad idea.
- Pull-up vs pull-down when dealing with buttons or sensors.

Files here:
- `1_Blink.ino` — the classic blink.
- `1_led_sensor_example.ino` — let a sensor drive your LED.
- `1_Blink_OOP.ino` — same party, object-oriented guest list.

Hack safe, keep smoke inside the parts.
