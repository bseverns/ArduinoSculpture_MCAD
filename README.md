# Classy Tidings
Sculpture Studio: Arduino  
SC 3082 Spring19

This repo is the playground for SC 3082 "Sculpture Studio: Arduino", Spring 2019 at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design.

## Units

We carved each chunk of the course into its own folder:

- [unit1](unit1/README.md) — make an LED blink, read some sensors, and dip a toe into OOP without selling your soul.
- [unit2](unit2/README.md) — wrestle motors with an H-bridge and learn why power supplies hate you.
- [unit4](unit4/README.md) — spot warm bodies with PIR sensors and trigger noise like a pro.
- [unit5](unit5/README.md) — sling data between Arduino, Processing, and the web without losing any bytes.

Unit numbers follow the original syllabus, so yeah, we jump from 2 to 4. That's punk.
